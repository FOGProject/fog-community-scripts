#Note:
# Trying to run this on the fog repo with more than a few systems at a time across a small
# internet pipe will likely result in a few of the nodes failing to clone.
# You may install and use trickle, but it's not available by default on many OSs.
# you can always download it and install it though, by copying the install script and then modifying the copy.
# The command to clone fog using trickle would be:

# trickle -sd 100 git clone https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject.git /root/git/fogproject > /dev/null 2>&1

# Just replace the existing git clone command with that and all nodes would download at 1,000Kbps, or 1Mbps.

# If you're reading this after you've had a clone failure, just add a command at the begining to delete the clone, and to kill any git processes as well. Such as:

# pkill -f git > /dev/null 2>&1;rm -rf /root/git/fogproject;
