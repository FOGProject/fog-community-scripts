<p>This dashboard contains test-results for the FOG Installation process. These tests are ran daily, automatically. All OSs listed are server editions and are minimal installations. The process followed to conduct these tests are as follows, in order.</p>
<ol>
    <li>A new volume is created for each OS and is attached. This new volume is created from an existing clean snapshot containing no fog installation and is perodically updated every few months with the latest patches to keep testing times low</li>
    <li>The OS is started up and given 90 seconds to boot.</li>
    <li>Patching the OS begins. Each OS gets the correct patch commands issued.</li>
    <li>The exit code of patching is retrieved as well as output from the patching process.</li>
    <li>The OS is rebooted and given 90 seconds to complete.</li>
    <li>The latest code is pulled from the FOG Project repository.</li>
    <li>The current branch being tested is switched to.</li>
    <li>The FOG installer is executed using the <font color="red">'-y'</font> switch. Example: <font color=red>./installfog.sh -y</font></li>
    <li>The exit code of the installation process is retrieved as well as the fog installer's error log and it's installer output.</li>
    <li>The above process is repeated for each branch being tested, and for each OS being tested.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these tests are performed in AWS. As such, some OSs may not be included due to official AMI availability. Others may not be included due to complications with automation. An OS being excluded does not mean they wouldn't work with FOG. Simply, this test cannot confirm they work with FOG.</p>
